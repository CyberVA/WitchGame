These AI scripts heavily reference the source code from a youtuber called SebLague who does a tutorial series on A* pathfinding.
The code was heavily adapted to work with our project and specific needs, so the code on our project is not identical to the code presented by SebLague.
You can find the original code on SebLagues youtube channel or on his git repository at: https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding.
